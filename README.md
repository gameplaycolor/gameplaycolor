# Game Play Color

[![Build](https://github.com/gameplaycolor/gameplaycolor/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gameplaycolor/gameplaycolor/actions/workflows/main.yml)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6b57f8f0-fdc2-4372-a0ad-d7c8cb35f612/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gameplaycolor/deploys)

A JavaScript Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulator for iOS, based on the [GameBoy-Online](https://github.com/taisel/GameBoy-Online) emulator core.

If you just want to play Game Play, you can find it online at [https://gameplaycolor.com](https://gameplaycolor.com).

**Note:** Game Play Color is no longer under active feature developmentâ€”now that emulators are permitted on the App Store, there are many more fully featured alternatives, including the fabulous [Delta](https://apps.apple.com/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688). Issues with the current functionality are still being tracked and I'll do my best to keep the lights on.

## Dependencies

Check out the project, update the submodules, install the brew-based dependencies, and install the additional Python dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gameplaycolor/gameplaycolor.git
cd gameplaycolor
git submodule update --init --recursive
scripts/install-dependencies.sh
```

It may be necessary to install pipenv as follows:

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
```

## Builds

Game Play is built using a custom Python build script which inlines and minifies HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and binds in the settings for a given deployment.

For example, building the release version of Game Play as hosted on [gameplaycolor.com](https://gameplaycolor.com) can be done by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
scripts/gameplay build settings/release.json
```

The build will be created in the `build` directory, and a corresponding *.tar.gz will be created in `archives`, tagged with the git sha and settings name (e.g., `build-168bd9d0d8d309a1efb1983bd61ec34ff22951b5-release.tar.gz`).

## Development

The `gameplay` build script includes a lightweight server for local development:

```
scripts/gameplay serve
```

This does not automatically build the project, so it's necessary to build the project using the instructions [above](#building) whenever you make a change.

## Releases

The `main` branch is automatically deployed using continuous integration at [https://app.gameplaycolor.com](https://app.gameplaycolor.com). You can find an auto-gemerated changelog at [https://gameplaycolor.com/changelog/](https://gameplaycolor.com/changelog/).
