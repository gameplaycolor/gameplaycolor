                        51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                Preamble

      The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
    at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
    General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
    software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
    You can use it for your programs, too.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
    sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
    software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
    that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
    programs; and that you know you can do these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

      For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

      0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
    distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
    "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
    on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
    Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
    licensee is addressed as "you".

      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
    other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
    along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy.

      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
    1 above, provided that you also do the following:

        a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
        you changed the files and the date of any change; and

        b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
        in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
        with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
        third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
        that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
        third parties, at your option).

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
        run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
        in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
        Public License.

        d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
        copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
        exchange for a fee.

    Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
    derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
    the other work under the scope of these terms.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
    it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

        b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
        for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
        Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

        c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
        corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

    Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
    exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
    libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
    file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
    accompany that operating system.

      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
    Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
    Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
    the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
    the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
    remain in full compliance.

      5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
    on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
    and all its terms and conditions.

      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
    licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
    terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
    recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    
      7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.

      8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

      9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
            Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
        any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA


    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
    commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
    c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
    program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
      at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

      <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice

    That's all there is to it!
